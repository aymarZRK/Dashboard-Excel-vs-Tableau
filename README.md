# Dashboard Excel vs Tableau

I created a dynamic dashboard to illustrate a company's Net Sales and Gross Profit through its Twelve Last Month (LTM) and through the months included in his Yet To Date period (YTD)

The dashboard also illustrates the volume of sales not only by Client Type but also by product size.

Finally, the dashboard shows 2 KPIs: The Average Discount (%) during the period of analysis and the Average Distribution Cost (%) for the same period

I built the dashboard with Excel as well as with Tableau. Whether in Excel or Tableau, the user gets access of filters in order to provide flexibility in the process of the analysis.
